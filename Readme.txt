Note:
Currently, the search by video ID works on unlisted videos but the search by channel ID only works on public videos.
I can change this by using OAuth but it requires adding the web server domain as an authorized URI. For now I just left 
the videos public so we can get things working and everyone can test it. Once the web server is setup we can activate OAuth.
